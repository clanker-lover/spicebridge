# Terms of Service

*Last updated: February 13, 2026*

## 1. Acceptance

By using SPICEBridge, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the software or service.

## 2. Description of Service

SPICEBridge is a free, open-source circuit design and SPICE simulation tool licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0). It is available both as a locally installable Python package and as a hosted MCP server.

## 3. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. There is no guarantee that simulation results are accurate, complete, or suitable for any particular application.

## 4. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, CONTRIBUTORS, OR SERVICE OPERATORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE, OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE.

This includes, without limitation, any damages arising from:

- Circuit designs generated or simulated using SPICEBridge
- Component values calculated or recommended by the software
- Decisions made based on simulation results, schematics, or analysis output

## 5. User Responsibility

You are solely responsible for verifying and validating any circuit design before manufacturing, prototyping, or production use. SPICEBridge is a design aid, not a substitute for professional engineering review. Simulation results are approximations based on idealized models and may not reflect real-world behavior.

## 6. No Affiliation

SPICEBridge is an independent open-source project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic, PBC or any other company. Use of SPICEBridge through Claude or any other AI assistant does not imply endorsement by the AI provider.

## 7. Open-Source License

The source code is governed by the GPL-3.0 license. These Terms of Service apply to use of the hosted service and supplement (but do not replace) the GPL-3.0 license for the software itself. In the event of a conflict between these terms and the GPL-3.0, the GPL-3.0 governs for the source code.

## 8. Changes

These terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
