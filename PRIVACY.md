# Privacy Policy

**SPICEBridge** is an open-source MCP server for AI-assisted circuit design and SPICE simulation.

## Data Collection

SPICEBridge does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Circuit Data

Circuit netlists submitted for simulation are held in server memory for the duration of the session. They are discarded when the server process ends. No circuit data is persisted to disk, logged, or shared with any third party.

## Tracking and Analytics

SPICEBridge employs no analytics, cookies, tracking pixels, user accounts, or identification mechanisms of any kind.

## Authentication

No authentication is required to use SPICEBridge. No credentials are collected or stored.

## Public Endpoint

The public server at `spicebridge.clanker-lover.work` uses a Cloudflare tunnel for HTTPS. This provides standard TLS termination only. No user data is forwarded to or stored by Cloudflare beyond what is necessary for TLS transport.

## Open Source

The complete server source code is publicly available at [github.com/clanker-lover/spicebridge](https://github.com/clanker-lover/spicebridge) for independent verification of all claims in this policy.
